## Addressing Constructs

### CIDs

Each software entity communicating using RDMnet is referred to as a _component_. Each component has
a unique ID called a _Component ID_, or _CID_. A CID is simply a
[UUID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier). Components should, wherever
possible, make sure their CID doesn't change throughout the lifetime of the corresponding product.
For pure-software components like desktop or mobile applications, this typically means generating
and storing the CID as persistent data associated with each distinct installation of the software.
For hardware-locked components like lighting fixtures or gateways, it's often convenient to
generate a CID using the UUID version 3 or version 5 method, seeded with some static property of
the hardware such as a MAC address.

### UIDs

In addition to its CID, each component in RDMnet also has an RDM Unique ID (UID). This is for 
compatibility with the RDM protocol.

RDM UIDs are a six-byte identifier, divided into two parts:

```
mm:mm:dd:dd:dd:dd
```

Where `mm:mm` is the 2-byte ESTA Manufacturer ID (valid range `0x0000` to `0x7fff`) and
`dd:dd:dd:dd` is the 4-byte Device ID.

Hardware-locked devices typically have a UID assigned by combining an organization's ESTA
manufacturer ID with a device ID generated at time of manufacture and unique among all products
manufactured by that organization.

#### Dynamic UIDs

RDMnet also introduces the concept of dynamic UIDs, which are assigned by a broker at runtime.
Dynamic UIDs are useful for pure software devices of which many instances can be downloaded and
used on the personal devices of users.

A dynamic UID is assigned to a component by a broker on initial connection, and becomes invalid
after disconnecting; the component will get another, possibly different dynamic UID if it connects
again. Think of a dynamic UID like a DHCP-assigned IP address - it is not permanent and has a lease
time equal to the length of the RDMnet connection.

This illustrates the importance of the CID as a permanent identifier for an RDMnet component. To
continue the analogy, a CID is like a MAC address. Some broker implementations may use CIDs in this
way to re-assign the same dynamic UID to a component on reconnection, although this behavior is not
guaranteed.

RDMnet devices can also contain additional virtual RDM responders with dynamic UIDs; in this case,
the corresponding permanent identifier is called a _Responder ID (RID)_. See
\ref devices_and_gateways for more information on virtual responders and RIDs.

A dynamic UID is identified by the top bit of the Manufacturer ID field being set to 1. Recall that
only manufacturer IDs from `0x0000` to `0x7fff` are assigned, which allows this reserved bit to be
used to indicate a dynamic UID.

## Component Roles

Components in RDMnet fall into 3 subcategories: Controllers, Devices and Brokers.

### Controllers

An RDMnet controller originates and sends RDM commands to devices, and handles RDM responses from
those devices. At a high level, a controller's job is to allow the user to discover and configure
RDMnet devices. Typical examples of controllers are lighting console software, lighting network
configuration software, and mobile lighting network monitoring apps.

Controllers can participate in one or more RDMnet scopes. All controllers must by default be
configured to discover and connect to the default RDMnet scope (the string `default`). Additional
scopes can also be added (and the default scope removed, if desired) by user configuration.

In each scope, controllers connect to a broker for that scope, either by discovering the broker
using DNS-SD, or connecting to a preconfigured IP address and port. Controllers can then send a
command to retrieve a list of other controllers and devices connected to each broker.

The reply to this command will contain the following information about each component currently
connected:

* Its CID
* Its RDM UID
* Whether it is a device or a controller

This information is all that is necessary for the controller to retrieve more information about
each component using RDM commands.

### Devices

RDMnet devices are the primary recipients of configuration in RDMnet. A device is typically (but
not always) a piece of hardware-locked equipment; a lighting fixture, a DMX gateway, etc.

Devices can only participate in one RDMnet scope at a time. All devices must by default be
configured to discover and connect to the default RDMnet scope (the string `default`); this can
be changed by user configuration.

Devices connect to a broker for their configured scope either by discovering the broker using
DNS-SD or by connecting to a preconfigured IP address and port. Once connected, devices are 
passive; they wait to receive RDM commands before acting on them and sending responses.

In addition to accepting configuration themselves, devices can also represent and forward
configuration to and from other RDM responders; see \ref devices_and_gateways for more details
about this.

### Brokers

Brokers are the backbone of an RDMnet scope. They route messages between controllers and devices on
the same scope; all RDMnet traffic between an RDMnet controller and device passes through a broker.

Like devices, brokers can only participate in a single RDMnet scope at a time. The presence of two
reachable brokers for the same RDMnet scope is a configuration error that needs to be corrected by
a user of an RDMnet product. RDMnet provides some mechanisms for this configuration error to be
avoided; most notably, brokers are required to probe their configured scope before starting up, and
remain in a standby mode until all conflicting brokers are no longer reachable.

Brokers are mostly transparent from the perspective of an RDMnet user, and simply serve as a router
for RDMnet messages from controllers to devices and back. However, brokers are also addressable
over RDM, and are identifiable by a CID and an RDM UID. RDM commands can be addressed directly to a
broker, and E1.33 provides a new PID, `BROKER_STATUS`, which allows some limited remote broker
configuration to be done via RDMnet.
