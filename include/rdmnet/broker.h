/// Starts some threads to handle messages and connections. The current breakdown (pending
/// concurrency optimization) is:
///   * Either:
///     + One thread per explicitly-specified network interface being listened on, or
///     + One thread, if listening on all interfaces
///   * A platform-dependent number of threads to receive messages from clients, depending on the
///     most efficient way to read large number of sockets on a given platform
///   * One thread to handle message routing between clients
///   * One thread to dispatch log messages
///
/// Periodically call Tick() to handle some cleanup and housekeeping. Call Shutdown() at exit, when
/// Broker services are no longer needed, or when a setting has changed. The Broker may send
/// notifications through the BrokerNotify interface.
